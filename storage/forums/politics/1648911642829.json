  "content": "Hello fellow Americans, I come to you today bearing a message of truth, honour and justice. The facts are as they are and so this thread isn't for the weak of mind. Under recent developments it has been inferred from cumulative data and research that our glorious ex-leader Donald Trump isn't a 6 foot muscular stud but actually a Japanese anime cat girl. Sorry to be the bearer of bad news but this is the truth and the sole truth. For further developments follow my profile. Thank you for your time.",
